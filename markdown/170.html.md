Form Truncation
===============

Sadly, browsers limit the size of any single entry to 65K. If you want to enter a really long entry, the easiest solution is to split it into two parts: one in the "Entry Body", and the other just below it in the "Extended Body". At least that way, you get 130K to work with.
