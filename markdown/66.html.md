Database settings

General settings
----------------

Customize how Serendipity behaves

**Blog name** [string] The title of your blog.

**Blog description** [string] Description of your blog.

**Blog's E-Mail address** [string] This configures the E-Mail address that is used as the "From"-Part of outgoing mails. Be sure to set this to an address that is recognized by the mailserver used on your host - many mailservers reject messages that have unknown From-addresses.

**Allow users to subscribe to entries?** [list] Allow users to subscribe to an entry and thereby receive a mail when new comments are made to that entry. Yes No.

**Use Double-Opt In for comment subscriptions?** [boolean] If enabled, when a comment is made where the person wants to be notified via e-mail about new comments to the same entry, he must confirm his subscription to the entry. This Double-Opt In is required by German law, for example.

**Use Tokens for Comment Moderation?** [boolean] If tokens are used, comments can be approved and deleted by clicking the email links without requiring login access to the blog. Note that this is a convenience feature, and if your mails get hijacked, those people can approve/delete the referenced comment without further authentication.

**Language** [list] Select the language for your blog.

**Charset selection** [list] Here you can toggle UTF-8 or native (ISO, EUC, ...) character sets. Some languages only have UTF-8 translations so that setting the charset to "Native" will have no effects. UTF-8 is suggested for new installations. Do not change this setting if you have already made entries with special characters - this may lead to corrupt characters. Be sure to read more on [http://www.s9y.org/index.php?node=46](http://www.s9y.org/index.php?node=46) about this issue.

**Calendar Type** [list] Choose your desired Calendar format.

**Use visitor's browser language as default** [boolean] Use visitor's browser language as default.

**Enable Plugin ACL for usergroups?** [boolean] If the option "Plugin ACL for usergroups" is enabled in the configuration, you can specify which usergroups are allowed to execute certain plugins/events.

Appearance and options
----------------------

Customize how Serendipity looks and feels.

**Entries to display on frontpage** [string] Number of entries to display for each page on the frontend.

**Entries to display in Feeds** [string] Number of entries to display for each page on the RSS Feed.

**How should search-results be sorted?** [list] Choose by Date (most recent first) or Relevance (number of hits for the searched term in a single entry).

**Activate strict RFC2616 RSS-Feed compliance** [list] NOT Enforcing RFC2616 means that all Conditional GETs to Serendipity will return entries last modified since the time of the last request. With that setting to "false", your visitors will get all articles since their last request, which is considered a good thing. However, some Agents like Planet act weird, if that happens, at it also violates RFC2616. So if you set this option to "TRUE" you will comply with that RFC, but readers of your RSS feed might miss items in their holidays. So either way, either it hearts Aggregators like Planet, or it hurts actual readers of your blog. If you are facing complaints from either side, you can toggle this option. Reference: [SourceForge](http://sourceforge.net/tracker/index.php?func=detail&aid=1461728&group_id=75065&atid=542822).

**Use gzip compressed pages** [boolean] To speed up delivery of pages, we can compress the pages we send to the visitor, given that his browser supports this. This is recommended.

**Enable use of popup windows** [boolean] Do you want to use popup windows for comments, trackbacks et al? Yes/No.

**Is serendipity embedded?** [boolean] If you want to embed serendipity within a regular page, set to true to discard any headers and just print the contents. You can make use of the indexFile option to use a wrapper class where you put your normal webpage headers. See the README file for more information! Yes No.

**Make external links clickable?** [boolean] "no": Unchecked external links (Top Exits, Top Referrers, User comments) are not shown/shown as plain text where applicable to prevent google spam (recommended). "yes": Unchecked external links are shown as hyperlinks. Can be overridden within sidebar plugin configuration! Yes No.

**Enable referrer tracking?** [boolean] Enabling the referrer tracking will show you which sites refer to your articles. Today this is often abused for spamming, so you can disable it if you want.

**Blocked Referers** [string] Are there any special hosts you want not to show up in the referers list? Separate the list of hostnames with ';' and note that the host is blocked by substring matches!

**URL Rewriting** [list] pretty URLs for your blog and make it better indexable for spiders like google. The webserver needs to support either mod\_rewrite or "[Allow Override](http://httpd.apache.org/docs/1.3/mod/core.html#allowoverride) All" for your serendipity dir. The default setting is auto-detected.

**Server time Offset** [string] Enter the amount of hours between the date of your webserver and your desired time zone.

**Show future entries** [boolean] If enabled, this will show all entries in the future on your blog. Default is to hide those entries and only show them if the publish date has arrived. Yes/No.

**Apply read-permissions for categories** [boolean] If enabled, the usergroup permission settings you setup for categories will be applied when logged-in users view your blog. If disabled, the read-permissions of the categories are NOT applied, but the positive effect is a little speedup on your blog. So if you don't need multi-user read permissions for your blog, disable this setting.

Image Conversion Settings
-------------------------

Enter general information about how serendipity should handle Images

**Use Imagemagick** [boolean] Do you have image magick installed and want to use it to resize images? Yes No.

**Path to convert binary** [string] Full path & name of your image magick convert binary.

**Thumbnail suffix** [string] Thumbnails will be named with the following format: original.[suffix].ext.

**Thumbnail max size** [string] Maximum size of thumbnail in constrained dimension.

**Thumbnail constrained dimension** [list] Dimension to be constrained to the thumbnail max size. The default "Largest" limits both dimensions, so neither can be greater than the max size; "Width" and "Height" only limit the chosen dimension, so the other could be larger than the max size.

**Max. file upload size** [string] Enter the maximum filesize for uploaded files in bytes. This setting can be overruled by server-side settings in PHP.ini: upload\_max\_filesize, post\_max\_size, max\_input\_time all take precedence over this option. An empty string means to only use the server-side limits.

**Max. width of image files for upload** [string] Enter the maximum image width in pixels for uploaded images.

**Max. height of image files for upload** [string] Enter the maximum image height in pixels for uploaded images.

**Enable on-the-fly media synchronization** [boolean] If enabled, Serendipity will compare the media database with the files stored on your server and synchronize the database and directory contents.

**Allow dynamic image resizing?** [boolean] If enabled, the media selector can return images in any requested size via a GET variable. The results are cached, and thus can create a large filebase if you make intensive use of it.

**Import EXIF/JPEG image data** [boolean]If enabled, existing EXIF/JPEG metadata of images will be parsed and stored in the database for display in the media gallery.

**Media properties** [string] Enter a list of ";" separated property fields you want to define for each media file(You can append ":MULTI" after any item to indicate that this item will contain long text instead of just some characters).

**Media keywords** [string] Enter a list of ";" separated words that you want to use as pre-defined keywords for media items.
