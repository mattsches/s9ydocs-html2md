Flickr Setup
============

Just download the [Import from Flickr Plugin](http://spartacus.s9y.org/cvs/additional_plugins/serendipity_event_flickr.zip) and follow the directions!

By far, the most common error with the Flickr plugin is "generate\_content(): Failed opening required 'Flickr/API.php'.

To correct this, download the [PEAR Flickr\_API](http://code.iamcal.com/php/flickr/readme.htm) and unzip it into either the Flickr plugin directory or the bundled-libs/ directory.
