Sticky Entries
==============

The Extended Properties for Entries plugin includes exactly this capability! Just install it from your admin screen like any other event plugin.

After it's installed, an extended options section appears at the bottom of each entry while you edit it. Just click the "Make this entry sticky" box to make it appear at the top of any list it appears in.
