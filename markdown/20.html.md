Repositories
============

Sourceforge / GitHUB
--------------------

Here are quick links to Serendipity's relevant Sourceforge pages. We use Sourceforge for maintaining the project releases and plugins/themes, but use GitHUB for maintaining our core sourcecode. In the future we plan to move everything to GitHUB.

Helping us?
-----------

If you want to help the s9y project, we are always looking for eager developers. We are also in need of people helping us to enlarge this Wiki. If you want to contribute there, please drop a message on the Serendipity [Forums](/22.html)!

Currently we're in special need of:

-   **Quality Assurance (QA):** Test our release packages. Install them from scratch, try updates from previous versions, make sure everything is working, check if the upgrader works along the different (CVS)-Versions.

-   **Documentation:** Write documents on how to use s9y, how to write plugins, how to generate templates, ...

-   **Translation:** Don't see a version in your language? Translate the appropriate language file, and send it to us.

-   **Design:** We're always interested in anyone who can help us design awesome templates or icons for Serendipity.

-   **Hosting:** As the project is growing, we need more infrastructure over time. If you're interested in sponsoring server/bandwidth, please contact jannis@gmail.com. Thanks go out to our friends over at [BASE](http://www.base.de/) who support the s9y project.

In addition to the above list, we are always interested in ideas or patches for Serendipity, even reporting bugs helps us create better software.

If you think you can help us out, just drop a mail on our forums.

Patches for Language translations, bug fixes are best submitted to us from a recent GitHUB checkout, unified diffs ("diff -u") or (even better) pull requests in GitHUB are appreciated.
