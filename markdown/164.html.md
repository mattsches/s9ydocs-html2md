Saving SpamBlock configuration
==============================

If your other plugins all work, then your server is probably trying to protect you by blocking forms with spam words in them. You can see the catch-22 here: you want to tell Serendipity what words are spam, which you must do via a form, but your provider is blocking forms that have spam words in them!

You can eliminate the spam words by using any non-empty string, such as ".". If the field is empty, Serendipity will believe you made no changes.

You can manually change the spam words in the database, using a tool such as phpMyAdmin.
