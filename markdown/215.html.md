Trackback
---------

A way for other blogs to let you know they're using your articles. Like a footnote, but in reverse. It is considered polite to provide a link and a trackback to any articles you reference.

Trackbacks can also be used for spam. It's annoying, but true. See [Disabling Trackbacks](/216.html) and [Removing Trackback Links](/214.html) for more information.
