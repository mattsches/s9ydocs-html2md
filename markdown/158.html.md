Missing Images
==============

This is usually caused by an incomplete or corrupted installation. Usually the images are simply not in the template directory, where they're expected to be.

Compare the installed files to the Serendipity archive. There are tools that can help, such as [WinMerge](http://winmerge.sourceforge.net/). Reupload any files that have been corrupted or are missing.

In extreme cases, you may wish to simply delete the Serendipity directory and reinstall.

Note that .php files are text, and should be uploaded in ASCII mode. Most other files in the Serendipity distribution are binary files and should be uploaded in BINARY mode. Many FTP tools detect file types automatically.
